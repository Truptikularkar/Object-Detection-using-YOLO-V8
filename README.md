# Object Detection using YOLOv8 for Webpage Elements

# Introduction

This GitHub repository contains code for a project on object detection using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system. The primary focus of this project is to develop a model that can detect various webpage elements such as breadcrumb, checkbox, container, dropdown forms, buttons, logo images, navigation dots, text, links, input fields, radio buttons, and modals.

# Project Overview

# YOLOv8 Model
The YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model is employed to perform object detection on webpage images. This model is chosen for its efficiency and accuracy in detecting multiple objects in an image simultaneously.

# Webpage Elements
The model is trained to identify the following webpage elements:

Breadcrumb
Checkbox
Container
Dropdown Forms
Buttons
Logo Images
Navigation Dots
Text
Links
Input Fields
Radio Buttons
Modal Windows

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.x
PyTorch
OpenCV
Other dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt file.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of webpage images annotated with bounding boxes around different elements.The annotation and labelling is done with the help of cvat.ai tool.
